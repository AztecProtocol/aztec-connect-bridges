/**
 * @title Aztec Connect Bridge for Liquity's LQTYStaking.sol
 * @author Jan Benes (@benesjan on Github and Telegram)
 * @notice You can use this contract to stake and unstake LQTY to and from LQTY staking contract.
 *
 * The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's implementation of ERC20 token because token balances are used to track
 * the depositor's ownership of the assets controlled by the bridge contract. The token is called LQTYStaking and
 * the token symbol is SB. During the first deposits an equal amount of SB tokens is minted as the amount of LQTY
 * deposited - 1 SB is worth 1 LQTY.  1 SB token stops being worth 1 LQTY once rewards are claimed. There are 2 types
 * of rewards in the LQTYStaking.sol: LUSD and ETH (see https://docs.liquity.org/faq/staking[Liquity docs] for more
 * details).
 *
 * Rewards are automatically claimed and swapped to LQTY before staking and unstaking. This allows for precise
 * computation of how much each SB is worth in terms of LQTY.
 *
 * Note: StakingBridge.sol is very similar to StabilityPoolBridge.sol.
