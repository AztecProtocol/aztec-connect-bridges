 * @title Subsidy
 * @notice A contract which allows anyone to subsidize a bridge
 * @author Jan Benes
 * @dev The goal of this contract is to allow anyone to subsidize a bridge. How the subsidy works is that when a bridge
 *      is subsidized it can call `claimSubsidy(...)` method and in that method the corresponding subsidy amount
 *      unlocks and can be claimed by the beneficiary. Beneficiary is expected to be the beneficiary address passed as
 *      part of the rollup data by the provider. When sufficient subsidy is present it makes it profitable for
 *      the rollup provider to execute a bridge call even when only a small amounts of user fees can be extracted. This
 *      effectively makes it possible for calls to low-use bridges to be included in a rollup block. Without subsidy,
 *      it might happen that the UX of these bridges would dramatically deteriorate since user might wait for a long
 *      time before her/his bridge call gets processed.
 *
 *      The subsidy is defined by a `gasPerMinute` amount and along with time since last interaction and the current
 *      base fee will be used to compute the amount of Eth that should be paid out to the rollup beneficiary.
 *      The subsidy will only ever grow to `Subsidy.gasUsage` gas. This value is the expected gas usage of the specific
 *      bridge interaction. Since only the base-fee is used, there will practically not be a free bridge interaction
 *      because the priority fee is paid on top. However the fee could be tiny in comparison -> over time user fee goes
 *      toward just paying the priority fee/tip. Making the subsidy payout dependent upon the time since last bridge
 *      call/interaction makes the probability of the bridge call being executed grow with time.
 *
 *      `Subsidy.minGasPerMinute` is used to define minimum acceptable value of `Subsidy.gasPerMinute' when subsidy
 *      is created. This is necessary because only 1 subsidy can be present at one time and not doing the check would
 *      open an opportunity for a griefing attack - attacker setting low subsidy which would take a long time to run
 *      out and effectively making it impossible for a legitimate subsidizer to subsidize a bridge.
 *
 *      Since we want to allow a subsidizer to subsidize specific bridge calls/interactions and not only all
 *      calls/interactions we use a `criteria` to distinguish different calls. The `criteria` value is computed in
 *      the bridge, and may use the inputs to `convert(...)`. It is expected to be different in different bridges
 *      (e.g. Uniswap bridge might compute this value based on `_inputAssetA`, `_outputAssetA` and a path defined in
 *      `_auxData`).
